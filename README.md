# Introduction

Ever wished Go had try-catch blocks? Well, wish granted! `go-trycatch` brings the familiar try-catch-finally pattern to Go, but with a twist - it's designed to complement Go's existing error handling philosophy, not replace it. Think of it as giving your error handling superpowers while keeping your Go code idiomatic. ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

`go-trycatch` comes packed with goodies:

1. Try-catch-finally pattern that feels like home (minus the endless exception hierarchies)
2. Automatic panic recovery that turns those scary panics into manageable errors
3. A chainable API so smooth it feels like writing poetry
4. Zero external dependencies (we're not that kind of library)
5. Finally blocks that actually run... finally
6. Plays nicely with your existing Go code (no drama)

# Why Choose go-trycatch?

-   **Simple API that sparks joy**: Like Marie Kondo for your error handling
-   **Flexible error handling**: Catch and handle errors with ease (Pokemon style)
-   **Panic protection**: Turns those heart-stopping panics into well-behaved errors
-   **Cleanup guaranteed**: Finally block runs even if your code throws a tantrum
-   **Diet-friendly**: Zero dependencies, won't bloat your project
-   **Chainable like your favorite necklace**: Write code that reads like a story
-   **Go-native friendly**: Works alongside Go's error handling like best buddies
-   **Thread safety**: Safe to use in concurrent code

# Installation

To install `go-trycatch`, use the `go get` command:

```bash
go get github.com/shengyanli1982/go-trycatch
```

# Quick Start

Here's a taste of `go-trycatch` in action - it's so simple, your cat could probably use it:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    gtc "github.com/shengyanli1982/go-trycatch"
)

func main() {
    gtc.New().
        Try(func() error {
            // Your code that might return error or panic
            return fmt.Errorf("something went wrong")
        }).
        Catch(func(err error) {
            fmt.Printf("Caught error: %v\n", err)
        }).
        Finally(func() {
            fmt.Println("Cleanup code here")
        }).
        Do()
}
```

**Result**

```bash
$ go run demo.go
Caught error: something went wrong
Cleanup code here
```

# Features

## 1. The Three Musketeers: Try, Catch, and Finally

Every good story needs heroes, and here are ours:

-   `Try`: Where your brave code ventures forth
-   `Catch`: Your safety net when things go south
-   `Finally`: The cleanup crew that never calls in sick

### Example

```go
New().
    Try(func() error {
        // Main logic here
        return someFunction()
    }).
    Catch(func(err error) {
        // Error handling logic
        log.Printf("An error occurred: %v", err)
    }).
    Finally(func() {
        // Cleanup logic
        closeResources()
    }).
    Do()
```

## 2. Panic Recovery

`go-trycatch` automatically recovers from panics and converts them to errors that can be handled in the catch block.

### Example with Panic Handling

```go
New().
    Try(func() error {
        panic("unexpected error")
    }).
    Catch(func(err error) {
        fmt.Printf("Caught panic: %v\n", err)
    }).
    Do()
```

## 3. Cleanup with Finally

The `Finally` block ensures proper resource cleanup, executing regardless of whether an error occurred.

### Example with Resource Cleanup

```go
New().
    Try(func() error {
        return useResource(resource)
    }).
    Catch(func(err error) {
        log.Printf("Error using resource: %v", err)
    }).
    Finally(func() {
        releaseResource(resource)
    }).
    Do()
```

# Limitations

Let's be honest about what `go-trycatch` isn't:

-   A complete replacement for Go's error handling (we're here to complement, not conquer)
-   The fastest thing in the world (there's a tiny performance cost for all this convenience)
-   A magic wand for catching specific error types (though you can still do it with a bit of elbow grease)
-   No built-in support for catching specific error types (but you can implement this in your Catch function)
